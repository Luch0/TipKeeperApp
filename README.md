# TipKeeperApp

The purpose of this app is to keep track of the tips made during a work week. Also, the app will help calculate the
weekly earnings of the worker and serve as record keeping.

In the job I currently have, I receive tips in the end of my shift. At the restaurant, the waiter or waitress calculates the tip we made during the day and lets the other workers in the team know what was their cut. At first I tought about writing down the tip ammount or recording it in my note app on my phone. After some weeks I realized that there would be a better way to record tips and I decided to create an app that would help me keep track of my weekly tips.
